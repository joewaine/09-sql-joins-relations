# Project Name - SQL Join Relations

**Author**: Matt LeBlanc and Joe Waine
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This project was a primer on the concepts of SQL, we worked together to debug and include database schema and setup actions in order to populate the blog from a connected SQL database.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
In order to get going on your local set up, make sure you have the latest version of node and postgres installed. Also install necessary packages. For our project today we used postgres, express, and bodyparser.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are using a modern mvc architecture to manipulate our content using CRUD operations and SQL queries concatenated into javascript callback functions.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

Before we started today, none of these were working:

  Join all data from articles and authors tables on the author id value of each.

  Insert an author.

  Retrieve an author.

  Update an author.

  Insert an article.

  Retrieve an article.

  Update an article.

```
